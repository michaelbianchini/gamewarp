The Doctor has something cooking for this year&#39;s Science Expo, and I don&#39;t even have the brains to understand his grocery list, let alone his scientific notes.  I guess I should just be happy to have a job right now.  After the war, the pencil pushers are all over the place.  Let&#39;s get to mopping.
[[Get To Work-&gt;Inside Hallway]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Inside Hallway" tags="" position="302,187" size="100,100">I open the dingy closet door and back into the hallway.  The lights are flickering. I swear I fixed that bulb last week. Anyway, I push the bucket, squish the mop, mop the floor. Rinse, repeat. I notice that the [[Basement Door]] is cracked open.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Basement Door" tags="" position="302,336" size="100,100">Funny - that door was closed last time I was in the hall. Doc must be working late, he does that a lot.  I&#39;ll just give it a knock. &quot;Doc?&quot;  Oh well... I probably shouldn&#39;t bother him, he keeps secrets for good reason.  If we knew everything he did, well, we wouldn&#39;t understand, that&#39;s for sure.  He hasn&#39;t been the same ever since the war.  I just wish.. I could understand even a small piece of what he does every day. Oh well. Push, squish, mop, rinse, repeat. I am [[Hungry]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Hungry" tags="" position="302,487" size="100,100">Dinner break.  Hmm... [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]] or... [[something from one of those vending machines]]?  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="peanut butter and jelly sandwich" tags="" position="227,637" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="something from one of those vending machines" tags="" position="377,637" size="100,100">I have a few quarters in my pocket... Doc pays me well, that&#39;s for sure.  It&#39;s strange that he gave me a raise after I saw that machine of his...

As I munch on my Honey-Dew-Bar, I hear a noise in the lobby.  No one should be here this late except for Doc. Should I [[Investigate]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Investigate" tags="" position="376,785" size="100,100">I take my mop and hold it forward like one of them oriental swords that Doc had a picture of in his desk.  It fell out when I was cleaning up and he seemed pretty upset that I found it?

As I turn the corner, I see a shadow pass by the frosted glass window... I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just the trees. This time of year, the wind gets pretty bad. Should I [[check it out]] or [[head back to the break room]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="head back to the break room" tags="" position="376,936" size="100,100">I turn around and head back towards my little dinner area. Suddenly there&#39;s a tap on my shoulder amd I swing around - unfortunately, I forgot that the bucket was right behind me. I trip, fall, and almost get a bucket full of dirty water on my head. From out of the shadows comes a small waif-like creature with short hair, a buttoned jacket and a mischevious grin.  The doctor&#39;s daughter.

She stifles a laugh, obviously she feels bad and didn&#39;t mean to knock me over.  &quot;Very funny!&quot;  I shout. I pretend to be mad, but honestly, I&#39;m just glad she&#39;s giving me the time of day. Last week she didn&#39;t say one word to me, she had her head in those books all week. She has her own key, so she comes and goes as she pleases. She helps me up.

&quot;Seen my dad?&quot; she asks. I am not sure if he wants to be disturbed, usually, he doesn&#39;t.  I pride myself on being his gatekeeper when the security guard goes home. Even if it&#39;s his daughter. I decide to [[tell her not to disturb him]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="check it out" tags="" position="163,909" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="tell her not to disturb him" tags="" position="376,1086" size="100,100">I start to come up with an elaborate speech on how he&#39;s a very busy man, and in the middle of multiple projects, when she is already walking past me down the hall to the open door. &quot;Wait!&quot; I shout.

She&#39;s already down the hall and knocking on the door.  &quot;Dad, what are you doing down there?&quot; I catch up to the basement door as she is halfway down the stairs. I&#39;m still stupidly holding the mop. I decide to open my mouth and say &quot;I really think you should come back later, last time I came down here and he was in the middle of something, he was NOT happy.&quot;

It&#39;s true, I remember it like it was yesterday.  It was a little over a year ago, and I was looking for the banner for the expo.  We use the same one every year, just change the year on it.  That&#39;s when I saw the machine.  It was covered under a sheet, and I thought I saw the expo banner sticking out of the bottom, so I pulled on it.  I meant to pull out the banner only,s but the whole sheet came off.  I saw something I couldn&#39;t even begin to understand, but I never forgot it.

It was ten feet tall ; I know this because I&#39;m almost seven feet tall. It had several tubes connected to it, reminded me of the back of a washing machine. I tried to figure out what it was made for but before I could touch it, I heard the professor coming down the stairs.  I panicked.. I didn&#39;t want him to know I saw anything, even if it was an accident.  I threw the sheet over the top of it before he got to the bottom of the staircase. I&#39;m not sure if he knew I saw anything, but he sure was mad.  He said I had missed cleaning the entire food court area, as well as the bathrooms on the second floor.  And when I told him I was looking for the sign for the expo, he threw it at me and told me to get out.

Two weeks later, I made almost 25 dollars more. I&#39;m not sure if he gave me a raise because he felt bad for yelling at me or what. But ever since that night, I have seem students coming in late at night.  My shift always ends before they go home.  I never asked him about it, I just felt like he wouldn&#39;t like it. [[Back to Work]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Back to Work" tags="" position="376,1236" size="100,100">Here we are, almost a year later, and the night before the expo.  I have the sign, I just need to [[hang it up outside]]. But should I [[help her find her Dad]] first?  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="hang it up outside" tags="" position="301,1386" size="100,100">I decide against it.  She&#39;s already out of sight and it&#39;s not my place to get involved. I also want to protect myself... from him. Not that he would hurt me, but I&#39;ve got to think of my mom.  What would she do if I was fired for sticking my nose in his business?
